GruntJS-CoffeeScript-Compass-UglifyJS
=====================================

http://gruntjs.com/

A custom GruntJS script that will compile your CoffeeScript files, SASS files (using your own config file), and minify your files all in one go. This script has also been modified to support the grunt watch command which will take care of all of your new changes.

 This configuration by default will assume your folder structure is:
 
 * css
 * coffee
 * js
 * js-ext
 * sass

To run the script and do all the compilation:

**grunt**

To watch for new changes:

**grunt watch**
